        <h1>Welcome to the Novadev Blog!</h1>
        <p>I'm Morgan, a Full Stack Software Engineer (<a href="https://github.com/madaley1">github.com/madaley1</a>)!</p>
        <p>I've attempted blogging before, but it was always more complex than I wanted, and I felt like due to the complexity I needed to do more than just throw my thoughts out there, and I knew I wasn't wanting to do a fully professional devblog where you SEO optimize and tag everything perfectly for searchability, I just wanted a place to put some thoughts every once and a while.</p>
        <p>I found some other platforms, but none really were both simple and self-hosted, all required config and themes, or were restricted to a specific platform/site, so I decided I'd just make an unfancy, non-complex platform where you just write markdown and push.</p>
        <p>You can of course customize it via CSS, and you can edit the HTML outside of the autogenerated post areas, but otherwise it's meant to just essentially be a place to put text.</p>
        <p>Feel free to look around, or check out <a href="https://github.com/madaley1/nova-blog">the repo</a> for how to set up your own nova blog!</p>
        <small>Also the only reason my domain isn't novadev.github.io is because it was already taken, idk if it's even used but hopefully it'll come back open someday so I can steal it >:)</small>
