# Building a Blog

I had the idea the other day that a dev blog might help me keep on top of my ideas and projects, so I decided to start one.

That being said, I didn't realize how many technologies there were and how complex they are to set up and utilize, and I wanted something simpler, more web 1.0 than anything really.

I used to have a wordpress blog, but as you might have guessed, I didn't like using it because of the workflow.

I also didn't want to build one though, so I looked at [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev), but I didn't like that it wasn't self-hosted. To me it seemed like it should be simple enough to build and potentially even containerize, and that was the beginning of the end for me. As much as I didn't want to build yet *another* project when I have one started and another one I want to start, my brain just wouldn't let go of the thought:
> It won't even take a day to get something simple going, just do it.

So here it is.

I built a blog platform (or framework? Not sure how to define it since it was on a whim).

Despite that I didn't want to.

The workflow is much simpler than WordPress, you just clone the repo, push it to your github pages repo, and verify the actions are set up well, and you have a blog. Add a md file to todays date (or any date really), and push it up. It will generate an HTML page, generate the posts page, and add the most recent posts to home, all without you lifting a finger.

It's a basic app, but it does everything I need it to. And as annoyed as I was at not being able to avoid building it, I'm happy that I did.
