<p>I want to finish up this project. Not permanently mind, but I want to use it in my workflow and for that it needs to be minimally viable. To do that there are two major functionalities necessary - Delete and Edit.</p>
<p>I finished up delete today, but Edit has brought up some pretty substantial issues with the data flow not being one directional. After working with Python I also noticed my imports are not one directional either, so I feel like a refactor is necessary to get this into working order.</p></section>
