<p>Made the favicon for the Nova Blog, but figured I should try to have AI generate something for me since I didn't want to have to break out a photo editor just to make a 64x64 simple logo, so I made a really quick and dirty shape and tried to put it into the AI to clean it up. Here's the results:</p>
<h4 id="initial">Initial:</h4>
<p><img src="Untitled.png"/></p>
<h5 id="result">Result:</h5>
<p><img src="symmetrical_32x32_logo.png"/></p>
<p>Not very good at prompting, but here's what I put in: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Could you turn this into a 32x32 pixel art style logo and make it symmetrical, fixing up the proportions of the sides?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Safe to say AI isn't taking our jobs anytime soon. Mine isn't perfect, but here's what I wanted:</p>
<p><img src="blackBg.png"/></p>
<p>Also found out the images do not translate, so I'm updating the generation file to compensate</p></section>
